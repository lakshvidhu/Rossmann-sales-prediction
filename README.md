Introduction
Rossman is a drugstore company with multiple stores. Predicting sales is crucial for effective inventory management and overall business strategy. This project aims to build a predictive model that can forecast sales for each store based on various features.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution of features, relationships, and potential patterns.

Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features to improve the predictive power of the model.

Model Training: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to train a model on historical sales data.

Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

Prediction: Generating sales predictions for the test set.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
